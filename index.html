<h1>My name is Adam Daigian</h1>

<p>I'm currently working as a freelance growth product manager that focuses on design for grown and driving the feature roadmap based on insights from analytics.</p>

<p>For the next three months I will be taking the General Assembly Web Development Immersive in order to develop functional software development skills. I hope to be able to prototype proof of concept products using Ruby, JS and databases.</p>

<p>Following this course I'd like to work as a growth product manager.</p>
